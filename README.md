# HomeControlAndroid
A simple, easily extensible Android app for controlling various networked devices from a tablet or phone. Possibly for a cheap tablet mounted to the wall.

Currently there's a lot of hardcoded tokens, IP's, etc. so it needs some work before it will talk to your stuff. I'll probably implement autodiscovery at some point.

## Current Device Support
* CoAP connected JSON endpoints (great for embedded devices)
* TCP Connected (aka GreenWave Reality) lighting

## Planned Device Support
* LG TV's and Projectors
* Chromecast
